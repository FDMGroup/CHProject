CHProject

The Project we intend to embark on is to create a website to allow a company to change it's name.

This will include aspects of forms NE01 and NM01 and a consent to act in place of a signature.

As NE01 allows for a company to remove the Limited part of their company name, it is sensible to have this as an option on the change of name webform. The NE01 will later also be added to be accessed independently, for cases where removing 'Limited' is the only change a company wishes to make.

Once a company name and id have been confirmed with the database an image will be pulled from google images, this will be their company logo - this is where we will implement non-blocking. If we have time later on we may implement a confirmation of change of name via email.

The first step for this website will be to create a form to confirm an existing company name and id.
